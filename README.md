# CS-2150
Work from CS 2150 (Program and Data Representation) at the University of Virginia.
Lab descriptions as follows:

Lab 2: Advanced class development in C++, creating and using iterators, manipulating pointers, and implementing linked data structures.

Lab 3: Creating and implementing a stack data structure to execute a postfix calculator.

Lab 4: Using lldb debugger to examine the binary representation/storage of various data structures.

Lab 5: Creating a working tree calculator and functional implementations of Binary Search Trees and AVL Trees. Testing, evaluating, and comparing the relative performance of each tree implementation.

Lab 6: Implementing a hash table and exploring the effectiveness on runtime of various collision resolution techniques.

Lab 7: Becoming familiar with how high-level programs are represented at the machine-level using university-created language IBCM.
