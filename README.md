# CS-2150
Work from CS 2150 (Program and Data Representation) at the University of Virginia.
Lab descriptions:

Lab 2: Advanced class development in C++, creating and using iterators, manipulating pointers, and implementing linked data structures.

Lab 3: Creating and implementing a stack data structure to execute a postfix calculator.

Lab 4: Using lldb debugger to examine the binary representation/storage of various data structures.

Lab 5: Create a working tree calculator and functional implementations of Binary Search Trees and AVL Trees. Test, evaluate, and compare the relative performance of each tree implementation.

Lab 6: Implemente a hash table and explore the effectiveness on runtime of various collision resolution techniques.

Lab 7: Become familiar with how high-level programs are represented at the machine-level using university-created language IBCM.
